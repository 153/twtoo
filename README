twtoo or "twitter to tooter" is an app that brings Tweets to a Mastodon account.

How to install:
1. Install "twint" and "Mastodon.py"
2. Modify "config.py" to include the twitter account you want to mirror, 
   the URL of your mastodon instance, and your mastodon email address 
   (aka login username) and password.
3. Run "register.py" in python3 to link this app and your user.
4. Run "loop.py" to start checking the target twitter account every
   20 seconds.

Next release features (v1.0):
- embed images/video
- prefix with "quote_url" if quote-tweeting
- affix conversation members at end of message, if not explicitly 
  mentioned
- append @twitter.com to all usernames
- conclude with newlines, link to original tweet

Planned future features (v2.0):
- many twitter feeds to one mastodon users (eg 3 users -> 1 user)
- plural twitter feeds to plural mastodon users (eg 1->1, 1->1, etc)
